Getting Started
    Prerequisites
      java runtime environment (ideally latest version) is needed.

    Setup & Installation
      All *.class files should be placed in the same directory.

      In addition to the java/classs files, there additional files must exist (or created) in the same working diretory, namely:

      1. users.csv contains username and password and must be setup and edited by the adminstrator before executing the program.

      2. projects.csv contains project details. Projects details must be edited accroding to the format specified in the first comment line (preceed by a # sign). The idea is that this projects.csv file will be replaced a by database.

      3. taskObject.txt contains the detailed information of the tasks in the object form. This file will be automatically created by the program and should never be editied or removed.

    Execution
      javac Run
